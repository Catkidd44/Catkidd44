## 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Breton

I am a Data Scientist & Analytics Engineer and MSBA candidate at UT Austin who specializes in building automated, zero-intervention pipelines and predictive models that transform complex, high-frequency datasets into high-stakes business growth. My technical expertise spans Python (PyTorch, Scikit-learn), SQL, Snowflake (Medallion Architecture), and Tableau, with deep specialization in Deep Learning (MLP), Marketplace Logistics, NLP Sentiment Analysis, and A/B Testing.

I have a proven track record of delivering measurable impact, including developing MLP models (R^2=0.93) to optimize marketplace efficiency using geospatial and temporal data, as well as engineering NLP-driven ranking engines and scalable Snowflake architectures. These efforts have consistently translated into strategic results. Also I love Jiu Jitsu and Chess, nnot everything should be data related. In addition, I'm an avid open mic atteendee and try to get better at performing with my guitar.
