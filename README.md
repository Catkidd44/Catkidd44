## 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Breton

I am a Data Scientist and Analyst and MSBA candidate at UT Austin with a focus on building predictive models that transform complex, high-frequency datasets into actionable business growth. My technical expertise spans Python (PyTorch, Scikit-learn), SQL, Snowflake (Medallion Architecture), and Tableau, with deep specialization in Deep Learning (MLP), Marketplace Logistics, NLP Sentiment Analysis, and A/B Testing.

I have a proven track record of delivering measurable impact, including developing MLP models to optimize marketplace efficiency using structured data, as well as engineering NLP-driven ranking engines and scalable Snowflake architectures. These efforts have consistently translated into strategic results. Outside of the data world, I love Jiu Jitsu and Chess, as I believe not everything should be data-related. In addition, I'm an avid open mic attendee and am constantly trying to get better at performing with my guitar
