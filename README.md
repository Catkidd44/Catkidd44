## 👋 Hi, I'm Christian Breton

I am a Data Scientist and Analyst. I'm an  MSBA candidate at UT Austin with a focus on building predictive models that transform complex, high-frequency datasets into actionable business growth. My technical expertise spans Python (PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pytorch, TensorFlow, NLP etc.), SQL, Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI etc. with deep interest in Deep Learning (MLP), ML Engineering  NLP, and A/B Testing. I like to build stuff and make it better.

 Outside of the data world, I love Jiu Jitsu and Chess. I also am an avid open mic attendee and am constantly trying to get better at performing with my guitar and singing.
 I hope you enjoy going through this portofolio as much as I did with each project.
