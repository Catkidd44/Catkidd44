## **ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Christian Breton** 

I'm a **Data Analyst** with **2.5 years of experience**, turning raw data into insights that drive decisions. I have a Bachelorâ€™s in Information Systems, and I am currently pursuing my MSBA (Master of Science in Business Analytics) I have a passion for working with databses that drive me insane at first but provide great relief once I make the code work. 

Right now,Iâ€™m enhancing my Python expertise, deepening my SQL proficiency, and deepening my understanding of Power BI while exploring machine learning to become a well-rounded data analyst.  
ðŸš€ Always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and interesting datasets!
